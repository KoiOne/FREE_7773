# MLSys Code

## Training

### Progressively improving our training code

Make sure you run [Metaflow tutorial](https://metaflow.org/) first. When you are ready,
you can run small flow with:

`python small_flow.py run`

## Deploying

Make sure to have [installed Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation), configured with your AWS credentials.

`serverless deploy --aws-profile myProfile`
