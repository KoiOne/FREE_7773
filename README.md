# FREE_7773
Repo containing material for the NYU class (Master of Engineering) I teach on NLP, ML Sys etc.

This repo is a WIP: check back often for updates, documentation, new slides etc.


## Prequisites: Dependencies

Different sub-projects may have different requirements, as specified in the 
_requirements.txt_ files to be found in the various folders. We recommend using
[virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to 
keep environments isolated, i.e. creating a new environment:

`python3 -m venv venv`

then activating it and installing the required dependencies:

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##### Comet playground

The file `comet_playground.py` is a simple adaptation of Comet onboarding script for sklearn: if run correctly,
the Comet dashboard should start displaying experiments under the chosen project name.
 
Make sure to set `COMET_API_KEY` and `MY_PROJECT_NAME` as env variables before running the script.
