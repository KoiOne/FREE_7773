# FREE_7773
Repo containing material for the NYU class (Master of Engineering) I teach on NLP, ML Sys etc.

This repo is a WIP: check back often for updates, documentation, new slides etc.

Last update: Fall 2021.

## Prequisites: Dependencies

Different sub-projects may have different requirements, as specified in the 
_requirements.txt_ files to be found in the various folders. We recommend using
[virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to 
keep environments isolated, i.e. creating a new environment:

`python3 -m venv venv`

then activating it and installing the required dependencies:

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Slides

The folder contains slides discussed during the course: while they provide a guide and a general overview of the concepts, the discussions we have during lectures are very important to put the material in the right context.

Note that, with time, links and references may become obsolete despite my best intentions!

### Playground

This

##### Comet playground

The file `comet_playground.py` is a simple adaptation of Comet onboarding script for sklearn: if run correctly,
the Comet dashboard should start displaying experiments under the chosen project name.
 
Make sure to set `COMET_API_KEY` and `MY_PROJECT_NAME` as env variables before running the script.
